# ♟️ Fusion Grid – Chess Meets Connect 4

**Fusion Grid** is a real-time, multiplayer strategy game that blends the mechanics of **Chess** and **Connect 4**, originally developed for the **top 50 finalists** of [Technothlon Mains-2023](https://technothlon.techniche.org/) – a national-level logic-based competition with over **50,000 participants** across India.

## 🚀 Game Concept

Fusion Grid introduces a hybrid gameplay experience where:

- **Chess pieces** operate on a **Connect 4-style grid**
- Players must strategize their moves using **turn-based logic** and **gravity constraints**
- Unique win conditions challenge conventional board game thinking

## 👨‍💻 My Role

I led the development of a **responsive**, **real-time multiplayer** web game that:
- Allowed seamless play between users across different devices
- Handled **live game state synchronization** using WebSockets
- Enforced custom **game rules and constraints** through backend logic
